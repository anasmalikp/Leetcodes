<b>Single Number</b>

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

```csharp
public class Solution
{
    public int SingleNumber(int[] nums)
    {
        return nums.GroupBy(x => x).Where(x => x.Count() == 1).Select(x => x.Key).First();
    }
}
