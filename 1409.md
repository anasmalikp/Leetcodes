Queries on a Permutation With Key

Given the array queries of positive integers between 1 and m, you have to process all queries[i] (from i=0 to i=queries.length-1) according to the following rules:

In the beginning, you have the permutation P=[1,2,3,...,m].
For the current i, find the position of queries[i] in the permutation P (indexing from 0) and then move this at the beginning of the permutation P. Notice that the position of queries[i] in P is the result for queries[i].
Return an array containing the result for the given queries.

```csharp
public class Solution
{
    public int[] ProcessQueries(int[] queries, int m)
    {
        List<int> permutation = new List<int>();
        int[] result = new int[queries.Length];
        for(int i = 1; i <=m; i++)
        {
            permutation.Add(i);
        }
        for (int i =0; i<queries.Length; i++)
        {
            int index = permutation.IndexOf(queries[i]);
            result[i] = index;
            permutation.RemoveAt(index);
            permutation.Insert(0, queries[i]);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
