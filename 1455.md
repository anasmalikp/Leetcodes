<b>Check If a Word Occurs As a Prefix of Any Word in a Sentence</b>

Given a sentence that consists of some words separated by a single space, and a searchWord, check if searchWord is a prefix of any word in sentence.

Return the index of the word in sentence (1-indexed) where searchWord is a prefix of this word. If searchWord is a prefix of more than one word, return the index of the first word (minimum index). If there is no such word return -1.

A prefix of a string s is any leading contiguous substring of s.

```csharp
public class Solution
{
    public int IsPrefixOfWord(string sentence, string searchWord)
    {
        string[] words = sentence.Split(" ");
        for (int i = 0; i < words.Length; i++)
        {
            if (words[i].StartsWith(searchWord)){
                return i + 1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
