<b>Sorting the Sentence</b>

A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters.

A sentence can be shuffled by appending the 1-indexed word position to each word then rearranging the words in the sentence.

For example, the sentence "This is a sentence" can be shuffled as "sentence4 a3 is2 This1" or "is2 sentence4 This1 a3".
Given a shuffled sentence s containing no more than 9 words, reconstruct and return the original sentence.


```csharp
public class Solution
{
    public string SortSentence(string s)
    {
        string[] words = s.Split(' ');
        Array.Sort(words, (a, b) => {
            return a.ToCharArray()[a.Length - 1] - b.ToCharArray()[b.Length - 1];
        });

        for (int i = 0; i < words.Length; i++)
        {
            words[i] = words[i].Substring(0, words[i].Length - 1);
        }

        return string.Join(" ", words);
    }
}
