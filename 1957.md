Delete Characters to Make Fancy String

A fancy string is a string where no three consecutive characters are equal.

Given a string s, delete the minimum possible number of characters from s to make it fancy.

Return the final string after the deletion. It can be shown that the answer will always be unique.


```csharp
public class Solution
{
    public string MakeFancyString(string s)
        => new string(s.Where((c, i) => i < 2 || !(s[i] == s[i - 1] && s[i] == s[i - 2])).ToArray());
}
