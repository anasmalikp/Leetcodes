Replace Words

In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other word to form another longer word - let's call this word derivative. For example, when the root "help" is followed by the word "ful", we can form a derivative "helpful".

Given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence consisting of words separated by spaces, replace all the derivatives in the sentence with the root forming it. If a derivative can be replaced by more than one root, replace it with the root that has the shortest length.

Return the sentence after the replacement.

```csharp
public class Solution
{
    public string ReplaceWords(IList<string> dictionary, string sentence)
    {
        List<string> sentenceList = new List<string>(sentence.Split(' '));

        for(int i = 0; i < sentenceList.Count; i++)
        {
            for(int j = 0; j < dictionary.Count; j++)
            {
                if (sentenceList[i].StartsWith(dictionary[j]))
                {
                    sentenceList[i] = dictionary[j];
                }
            }
        }

        string result = string.Join(" ", sentenceList);
        return result;
    }
}
