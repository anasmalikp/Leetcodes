 Jewels and Stones

You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".


```csharp
public class Solution
{
    public int NumJewelsInStones(string jewels, string stones)
    {
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < jewels.Length; i++)
        {
            for(int j = 0; j < stones.Length; j++)
            {
                if(jewels[i] == stones[j])
                {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
