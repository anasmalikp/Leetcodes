Uncommon Words from Two Sentences

A sentence is a string of single-space separated words where each word consists only of lowercase letters.

A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.

Given two sentences s1 and s2, return a list of all the uncommon words. You may return the answer in any order.

```csharp
public class Solution
{
    public string[] UncommonFromSentences(string s1, string s2)
    {
        string combined = s1 + " " + s2;

        string[] strArray = combined.Split(" ");

        var grouped = strArray.GroupBy(x => x).Where(x => x.Count() == 1).Select(x => x.Key).ToList();
        return grouped.ToArray();
    }
}
